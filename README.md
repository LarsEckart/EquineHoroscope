# EquineHoroscope

I think I got this project idea from a software development book back in the mid 1980s, but I haven't been able to identify the book. Perhaps it was a dream. I've built parts of this system a couple times, planning to use it for demos and classes. It goes out of date, however. The tools change, libraries change, computing environments change. It's very, very hard to keep a program in compilable condition without frequent attention over the years. So, I'm starting over and putting it in public this time.

## The "Requirements"

The core of the idea is to provide horoscopes for racehorses on race day. This gives the savvy bettor a leg up on the competition, allowing them to do better than the track odds predict. That's true, if the horoscopes work. Of course, no prediction mechanism works all the time. So if the horoscope doesn't pan out, it's just your bad luck. Try again, and I'm sure you'll win back your money. Horoscopes and horse-racing seem a natural combination.

Back in the 1980s it seemed like a novel idea to me. Now, a Google search shows me that people are in that very business. No matter. I will persevere.

I started with an example map (See https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction) of the initial features.

The **yellow** cards are Features. The **blue** cards are business rules. The **green** cards are scenarios I'll want to consider. And the **red** cards are questions.

## The Code

The code base started with [a fork](https://github.com/gdinwiddie/cucumber-java-skeleton/tree/eclipse-ready) of https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton modified for working in Eclipse.

In fact, right now it's unchanged from that fork.
