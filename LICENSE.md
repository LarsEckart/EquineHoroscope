It may seem odd to license code under a Creative Commons license, but this code is intended primarily for studying and practicing aspects of software development, not for being put into production. That doesn't mean that you can't use some parts in real projects, of course. 

For that reason, it's dual licensed with...

## What you may NOT do

Don't pass this code off as your own. That's just not cool. Give credit.

## What I'd like you to do

If you use this code, I'd appreciate hearing about it. How did it help? In what ways did it not work well? I'm putting it out there for community use. Please keep me, and that community, in the loop.

If you want to modify it, it would be best if you fork it on GitHub. Patch requests are welcome, particularly to help keep it viable over time.

Thank you.
